# Enhancements

## ToDo

add ability to provide CSV list for custom phonetic alphabet

----- then display the custom spellphabets in that dropdown menu (add name field to custom input to label list in the menu--provide a default incrementing name if none is selected)
add ability to delete custom word lists
add ability to export custom word lists ----- could just have a popover dialogue that gives a text field populated with the "csv" text

at narrowness breakpoint, switch settings list from row display to column

remove alert if no boxes checked. instead implement model like dashlane where you can't uncheck minimum # of boxes. but maybe throw a little error message so it's less confusing.

## Done

figure out how to exclude commonly confused characters
color numbers and symbols differently from letters

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
add phonetic alphabet field

set it all up so that the chosen basic settings can be shared
either using URL modifiers like the old one or with a settings export/import tool. latter is worse for single-action sharing of the tool.
either way requires figuring out how to make the settings reference a text area or something...

add alternate provided spellphabets that users can select from a dropdown menu

## Now irrelevant

style length [number] input to have separate + - buttons
